# Overview
Vera plugin for MyQ internet gateways. Allows you to control your MyQ enabled garage door openers, gate openers and lights using Vera. This plugin is based on the original code created by @macrho with some rewrites and fixes by @djrobx, @BOFH, @kornev @JoeyD and @cybrmage.  All rights and credit go to the original authors.

# Why does this repo exist here?

The plugin does not seem to be actively maintained and the Vera community has provided unofficial fixes as the MyQ API evolved. @lionelandjen provided TLS v1.2 fixes and @@CAB426 provided Brand API fixes.

If the original authors disagree with my hosting this as a convenience to the Vera community, I will respectfully remove the repo.
